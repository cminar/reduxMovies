## Movie Saga Site
Weekend project for Prime using Sagas.
## Description

To get this project spun up you will need to get a database up and running.
Call your database `saga_movies_weekend`
Check out the database.sql file for the needed commands. (including junction table)

then in terminal-

npm install
npm run server
npm run client

You are all spun up!

This site organizes 14 movies and displays them on the page with their title, poster, and description.

For more information on the movie simply click on the poster. You will be navigated to a page where you can read the information and edit it if you want to. Any changes you make will be stored in the database. 

You can navigate the site using the nav bar. There is a home button as well as a hamburger that lets you sort the movies by genre.

When you click on a genre you will be navigated to a page with only that genre of movies. 

I ran into an issue where when you try to navigate to another genre after you already navigated to one, the movie items will not get updated until you refresh the page. I tried a few things to fix this but unfortunately ran out of time.

Have fun!
